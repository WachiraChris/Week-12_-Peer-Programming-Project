# Week-12_-Peer-Programming-Project
Shifting Images

For today's group work, you will be writing simple Python functions to shift images in various directions. 

Shifting images would help increase the amount of data we have available for training and could in turn help increase the accuracy of our model. 

1. Load Data 

Load the mnist data from the scki-kit (sklearn) library and look at one of the images in the dataset. 

Note: The goal of this group work is solely to understand how to shift an image thus, you are not required to split the dataset as you would only focus on a few digits in the dataset. 

 

2. Shifting Images 

Hint: To shift images we can use the shift function from scipy.ndimage.interpolation 

2.1 Shift Image Up 

Pick an image from the dataset and view it. 

Now write a function to shift the image up by 1 pixel (You can test your function by shifting the image up by about 5 pixels and viewing it to observe the change in the digits position) 

2.2 Shift Image Down 

Pick an image from the dataset and view it. 

Now write a function to shift the image down by 1 pixel (You can test your function by shifting the image down by about 5 pixels and viewing it to observe the change in the digits position)  

2.3 Shift Image Right 

Pick an image from the dataset and view it. 

Now write a function to shift the image right by 1 pixel (You can test your function by shifting the image to the right by about 5 pixels and viewing it to observe the change in the digits position) 

2.4 Shift Image Left 

Pick an image from the dataset and view it. 

Now write a function to shift the image left by 1 pixel (You can test your function by shifting the image to the left by about 5 pixels and viewing it to observe the change in the digits position)
